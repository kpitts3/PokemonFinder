  # Instructions

    User will first see the home page with a button that says "Start Survey". Click the button to go to the next page

    Next reach each question and select an answer from the drop down that best represents how the question pertains to you.

    Once each question is filled out hit the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page. This will cause the web application to compare your answers to the Pokemon on file. Once one is found that is close to your standards a modal will pop up with the name of the Pokemon and an image of it.

    Enjoy!
